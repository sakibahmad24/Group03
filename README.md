# Software QA & Testing

This repository includes the project I did as a part of my undergrad course CSE427 (Software QA & Testing). Where me along with my group partner took a previous project we developed in android platform and tested the app following software testing methodologies. We could succesfully  implement UI testing, Integration Testing, Functionality Testing, Unit Testing, Input Space Partitioning and Graph Coverage Testing.
